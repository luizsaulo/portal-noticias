# Typescript News Portal
Creation of a system to organize a movie list
## 🚀 Starting

This project was built during  a React course on Udemy. The purpose is to apply all the techniques approached during the classes over the course.

### 📋 Requirements

Simple computer using your preferred operational system, or mobile device; nothing special.

## 🛠️ Technologies used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React
* Typescript

## 📌 Version

This is the first project built with Typescript. It brings an application that consumes an external API and renders news headlines according to pre established parameters.  

### 🔩 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop Typescript skills including styled components, which seemed to be very useful. It was deployed on Netlify, however there was a CORS problem I was unable to solve. I will try to get it fixed, but decided not to stop me from making this project public.
